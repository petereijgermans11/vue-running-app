# RunningFeet
This Project is made for Hogeschool Utrecht

The assignment was to create a Progressive Web App that
enables you to create Training Schemas for Running exercises.
This was made possible with Firebase. 

This project is also hosted [on firebase hosting!](https://runningfeet-45b38.web.app/#/workout)
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Build for production and enable PWA functionality
```
npm run build
```

### Build for production and host server to test the PWA functionality
```
npm run build && npx http-server dist
```
This command is the important one for the teachers of Hogeschool Utrecht! Run this one instead of npm run serve!

Navigate to localhost:8080 to see the PWA locally.
